        <p>
            My name is Michaela White. I am from a small town in Exeter, Maine where I grew up with my parents, two brothers and many animals. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. As a rising senior, I am going into my final year studying Science, Technology and Society with a concentration in Biotechnology and Biomedicine.

            Ever since I was a little girl I have always loved computers. Whenever my mom's old Dell desktop would break, I would be the one to fix it - just tinkering around and trying different possible solutions. I rediscovered my love for computers in college but the discovery came too late for me to make it the focus of my education. I'm an extremely competitive person and I love the challenge that programming presents. I also love innovation and having the tools to develop my own products is a dream I've had for a long time.
